\section{Personal Reflections}
\subsubsection{Florian Baumgartner}
% This bachelor's thesis proved to by very challenging, since it covered pretty much every field of electrical engineering. This, however, made it very attractive to work on the project, due to the enormous amount of variety in different topics. I personally could make use of my previously gained knowledge to accelerate the development process. It was a fantastic experience to design a fully working and professional looking product in such a small time frame. I'm very happy with the end result and hope that it will satisfy its purpose of convincing potential new students to start studying electrical engineering. It was a pleasure to work with Thierry Schwaller and we had overall a great time working on this project.
