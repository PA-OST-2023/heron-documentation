\chapter{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this thesis has delved into the task of
localizing and tracking a drone utilizing a microphone array.
Through a comprehensive evaluation of both software and hardware aspects,
new insights into the field have been gained, and
a custom built system has been developed.
With qualitative and quantitative measurements it has been shown,
that the proposed system is able to localize and track
drones in the open field.

\section{Continuing Work}

\bigskip
\begin{itemize}
	\item Build additional two arrays to allow exact localization
	\item Integrating a camera to visually show the drone's position
	\item Improve computation time of the beamforming
	\item More elaborate testing
	\item Classifying sound sources to distinguish between drones and other sources
	\item Developement and evaluation of a beamforming based tracker
\end{itemize}

\section{Personal Reflections}
\subsubsection{Florian Baumgartner}
Reflecting on this Master's project, I gained immense knowledge in audio processing, MEMS microphones, low-level networking, and GNSS RTK positioning.
Developing a fully functional microphone array in just four and a half months was a challenging yet rewarding experience that I'm very proud of.
Working with Alain Keller was a great experience, as we each brought different skills that complemented each other, making for a productive collaboration.
Although we faced some time management challenges, we were able to overcome them and deliver a working system.
I hope that this thesis will serve as a foundation for future projects that can build upon the work we have done.

\subsubsection{Alain Keller}
This thesis was enriching for me because it combined
the development and integration of algorithms, software and hardware.
I learned a lot of new concepts in the realms of signal processing,
and software development with Python.
Working with Florian Baumgartner gave me many insights
on how to tackle a hard and firmware project.
Along that I gained new experience in working
on a project and also got my learnings on what I could do
better in the future.
Ultimately I am proud that we were able to fulfill our task and
create a working system to track drones.
