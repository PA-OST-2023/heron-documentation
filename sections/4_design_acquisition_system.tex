\chapter{Acquisition-System Design}
\section{Overview}
This section covers the development process including the hardware and firmware design of the audio acquisition system.
The goal of the acquisition system is to provide a flexible microphone recording infrastructure to easily aquiring audio signals from multiple microphones.


\subsection{Key Requirements}
% The main focus of the development is to design a professional looking, easy to use and eye-catching device for demonstration purposes.
% The project name \textit{Audio-Beamformer} has been chosen as it is easy to remember and has potential to be seen as a trademark.

The following key requirements have been set:
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Single power adapter or power cable (e.g. no need of labor power supplies)
% 	\item Easy to install (e.g. montage on a camera tripod)
% 	\item Intuitive to operate via state-of-the-art graphical user interface
% 	\item Multiple audio streaming sources such as Bluetooth and USB input devices
% 	\item Great scalability and flexibility of the hardware and software design
% \end{itemize}

\subsection{Headphone Output}

To prelisten the individual audio channels, a headphone output is implemented.

	\subsubsection{Splash Screen}
	When the device is powered on, the splash screen is displayed until the boot process is finished.
	On average this takes about 5 seconds.
