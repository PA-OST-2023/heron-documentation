\chapter{Array Evaluation}
\section{Overview}
This section covers the complete development process including the hardware, gateware, software and mechanical design of the project. It is important to note that the following documentation concentrates only on the final version of the device. Earlier hardware prototypes are not covered due to the lack of relevance.

\section{Metrics}
TO evaluate the performance of an array several metrics are used.
In \todo{Cite Array design s40430-018-1275-5-1, array design comparisons} the
main beam-width is proposed.
\todo{cite Circ array drone trackings13638-019-1632-9} is using the ratio
between the main lobe power and the side lobe power.
Another measure related to the main lobe with is the main lobe area.
The main lobe is defined as all the points around the peak where their value
is greater than half the peaks value. \todo{besser englisch}
